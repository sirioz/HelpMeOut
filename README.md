# HelpMeOut

The project is composed by:

- 1 Caregiver app
- 1 Patient app
- Firebase cloud functions

# Testing
Testing the app requires to launch a local Firebase server.
- Cd into FIRCloudFunctions/test-server folder
- npm install
- npm start

NOTE: for some weird (documented) reasons the Firebase local server works only if you add the local address to /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 test.firebase.localhost

Documentation is in progres...
